### Add a new testbench

Webpack is configured (by us) to automatically bundle and serve any new testbench created. To add a new one, simply:

1. Create a new folder inside `testbenches` with the template's name
2. Add inside this new folder a file `index.html` and `main.ts`

With all this just run `npm run dev` and go to ()[http://localhost:8080/<new-template-name>.html]
